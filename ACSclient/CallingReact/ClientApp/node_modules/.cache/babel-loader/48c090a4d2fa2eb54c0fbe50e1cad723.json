It gives you a library of production-ready UI components that you can drop into your applications:\n *   - Composites: These components are turn-key solutions that implement common communication scenarios. You can quickly add video calling or chat experiences to your applications. Composites are open-source higher order components built using UI components.\n *   - UI Components - These components are open-source building blocks that let you build custom communications experience. Components are offered for both calling and chat capabilities that can be combined to build experiences.\n *\n * These UI client libraries all use Microsoft's Fluent design language and assets. Fluent UI provides a foundational layer for the UI Library and is actively used across Microsoft products.\n *\n * In conjunction with the UI components, the UI Library exposes a stateful client library for calling and chat. This client is agnostic to any specific state management framework and can be integrated with common state managers like Redux or React Context.\n * This stateful client library can be used with the UI Components to pass props and methods for the UI Components to render data. For more information, see Stateful Client Overview.\n *\n * For more information visit: https://aka.ms/acsstorybook\n *\n * @packageDocumentation\n */\nexport { fromFlatCommunicationIdentifier, toFlatCommunicationIdentifier } from '../../acs-ui-common/src';\nexport { CallClientProvider, CallAgentProvider, CallProvider, useCallClient, useCallAgent, useCall, useDeviceManager, getCallingSelector, createDefaultCallingHandlers } from '../../calling-component-bindings/src';\nexport { ChatClientProvider, ChatThreadClientProvider, useChatClient, useChatThreadClient, getChatSelector, createDefaultChatHandlers } from '../../chat-component-bindings/src';\nexport { _IdentifierProvider, CameraButton, ControlBar, ControlBarButton, DevicesButton, EndCallButton, ErrorBar, GridLayout, LocalizationProvider, MessageStatusIndicator, MessageThread, MicrophoneButton, ParticipantItem, ParticipantList, ParticipantsButton, ScreenShareButton, SendBox, StreamMedia, TypingIndicator, VideoGallery, VideoTile } from '../../react-components/src';\nexport * from '../../react-components/src/localization/locales';\nexport * from '../../react-components/src/theming';\nexport * from '../../calling-stateful-client/src';\nexport * from '../../chat-stateful-client/src';\nexport * from '../../react-composites/src';\nexport * from './mergedHooks'; //# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
